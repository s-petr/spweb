            Go is a great choice for a second language to specialize in as a
            JavaScript developer. It is a new language invented in 2009 at
            Google. It was designed for cloud services and server-side web
            applications. It is a strongly typed compiled language similar to C
            and C++. This means it runs much faster and is more memory efficient
            compared to interpreted languages like JavaScript. It compiles to a
            binary and doesn&apos;t need a runtime. At the same time it is easy
            to learn and has a garbage collector. So you do not need to manually
            manage memory like you do with low-level languages. Its popularity
            keeps growing and a lot of the new exciting startup companies are
            using Go as the back-end for their web services.

            better to go through this course after you are already familiar with
            other topics on this list. The instructor doesn&apos;t hold your
            hand and assumes that you are familiar with all the technologies
            being used, like TypeScript, React, Node JS, databases, Docker,
            Kubernetes, AWS. This course is massive, and just the videos are
            almost 100 hours long. But it&apos;s a good investment if you want
            to learn the entire process of building a microservices application
            from the ground up. Especially how the cloud infrastructure is set
            up, how all the components are connected and how they communicate
            with each other. How to set up services like Jenkins for the
            deployment pipeline, Elasticsearch with Kibana to collect logs, and
            Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring resources. How to spin up a
            Kubernetes cluster and use the Docker container registry. How to
            publish private custom NPM packages and use them in your services.

            as the back-end. Explains how to deploy Go microservices without
            relying on frameworks. Gives examples of how to set up messaging
            using a regular REST API as well as with RabbitMQ, Go RPC and gRPC.
            Learn how to deploy with Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.

            - the best introductory course about clean code. Teaches the
            fundamentals of creating readable and maintainable code. Shows
            common pitfalls and how to fix them. Most of the examples are
            written in JavaScript but the material is programming
            language-agnostic. Will teach you many &quot;quick wins&quot; -
            things that are easy to learn and implement that will substantially
            improve the quality of your code.

            - an overview of the 20 most common bad code anti-patterns
            (&quot;code smells&quot;) and how to recognize, fix and avoid them.
            These patterns often indicate badly structured code. They are not
            technically wrong but can slow down development and make it easy to
            introduce bugs in the future. The idea was made popular in the
            classic 1999 book{' '}

            material in the book. The examples are using TypeScript but the
            advice is applicable to any object-oriented programming language.

            - being able to use Git and GitHub for version control is a
            must-know skill for any software development. This course is the
            most complete one out there. It goes over all the key features,
            including the more advanced and obscure ones like git reflog and
            writing custom aliases.

            - covers the basics of databases and SQL without taking up too much
            of your time. There are better courses out there that go into more
            detail on specific topics and database types. But this one is the
            best introduction and starting point.

            - a deep dive into the inner workings of databases. Explains key
            concepts like transactions, ACID, isolation levels, locks and
            concurrency control. Discusses how databases store records in memory
            and on disk, what happens during reads and writes, how indexes work
            and the data structures they use. There are many practical exercises
            where you work with big tables, plan, evaluate and optimize SQL
            queries. This course will help you make intelligent decisions about
            which database technologies to use, how to structure tables and
            write performant queries.

            - you can get away with doing web development without knowing Linux,
            but it will put you at a big disadvantage. It will severely limit
            your options regarding the tools you can use and the jobs you are
            comfortable doing. This course covers all the important topics -
            setting up a Linux machine, using the command line, using package
            managers and common tools. There is a second part to this course
            where you practice setting up different Linux servers (

            first part and gives you real-world examples to experiment with.

            like Jest, Cypress should be easy to learn. This course is the most
            detailed Cypress course on Udemy and goes into all the important
            topics. You can use Cypress to run automated tests on any website.
            Both on your machine as well as inside a headless browser on a CI/CD
            server. It can also be used for web scraping.
